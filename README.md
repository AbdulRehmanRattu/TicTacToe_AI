## Overview

This project implements an optimal, mathematically unbeatable game engine for Tic-Tac-Toe using pure game-theoretic Minimax decision algorithms with Alpha-Beta pruning, wrapped in an interactive Pygame graphical user interface.

The AI agent exhaustively maps the discrete game state space to ensure it never loses a match, achieving optimal play against any human strategy whether playing first (as X) or second (as O).

## Problem Statement

Adversarial game-playing requires decision agents to evaluate prospective game trajectories and make mathematically optimal choices under zero-sum conditions. Developing game engines that guarantee zero-loss outcomes requires implementing exhaustive game-tree search algorithms (Minimax) optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate suboptimal recursive branches and maintain instant response latency within an interactive graphical user interface.

## Architectural Workflow

The game engine separates pure game state logic from graphical presentation:

## Key Features

- **Pure Functional State Transition**: State transitions are immutable (`result(board, action)` returns a new cloned board), ensuring tree search isolation without side-effects.
- **Unbeatable Minimax Decision Engine**: Recursively traverses the game tree to maximize player score while assuming optimal counter-play from the adversary.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization**: Tracks `alpha` (best guaranteed score for maximizer) and `beta` (best guaranteed score for minimizer), cutting redundant recursive branches when `alpha >= beta`.
- **Flexible Play Modes**: Choose to play as X (First Player) or O (Second Player) against the AI agent.
- **Interactive Pygame GUI**: Clean typography, responsive grid clicks, real-time status banners, and seamless restart controls.
